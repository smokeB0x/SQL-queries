# SQL-queries
A collection of SQL queries I use

1) dwb-Query
   - Query to interprert the digital wellbeing database from android phones.
   - Insert a timestamp in the line 'usageEvents.timeStamp > <insert timestamp here>'
     to filter on date/times, or remove the line entirely to see all events
