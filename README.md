# SQL-queries
A collection of SQL queries I use

1) dwb-Query
   - Query to interprert the digital wellbeing database from android phones.
   - Insert a timestamp in the line "insert timestamp here"
     to filter on date/times, or remove the line entirely to see all events
2) ei-extracter
   - Used on the Favicons.db file in the Safari app on iPhones.
   - filters the table to only show google URLs and extracts the ei-value (if there is one)
   - The ei-value can then be converted to a human readable time for when the search was conducted.
